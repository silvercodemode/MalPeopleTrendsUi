# Mal People Trends
Repo for: https://malpeopletrends.net/  

This is a site that shows how favorite counts have changed for people on https://myanimelist.net/ recently. This can show who is becoming more popular and trending recently as opposed to just showing who is already popular.

A separate Python script scrapes MyAnimeList daily to update the favorite counts for each day in a PostgresSQL database.
